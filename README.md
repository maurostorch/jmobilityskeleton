jMobilitySkeleton

This project presents three mobile patterns modeled as Template Methods for move computations among a set of machines. A socket-based structure was created for communications issues.
Mobile patterns

    Mmap - Execute a computation in each remote host and gets a result.
    Mfold - Execute a computation in a circular mode.
    Mzipper - Execute a computation in a handle circular mode.
